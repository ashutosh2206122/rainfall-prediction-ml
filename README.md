# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses historical Indian rainfall data from the IMD to build a machine learning model for predicting daily rainfall in mm using features like date and district.

## 📁 Dataset
- Indian Rainfall Dataset (District-wise Daily)
- Source: Kaggle / IMD

## 🧠 Model
- Linear Regression (baseline)
- Features: district, day, month
- Target: rainfall (in mm)

## 📊 Evaluation
- MAE: ~5.34 mm
- RMSE: ~11.28 mm

## 📈 Visualization
Actual vs Predicted rainfall plotted for sample district.
